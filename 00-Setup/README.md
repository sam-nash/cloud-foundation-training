# Cloud Foundation Toolkit Lab - 00-Setup

## 0. Prerequisite

* A [GCP Project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project) linked with a valid biiling account
* [Project IAM Admin](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#resource-manager-roles) (**roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin**) for your GCP account

## 1. What You'll Learn

* [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/)
* [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs)
* [Enable Google Cloud API](https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/enable-disable)
* [IAM Roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#iam-roles)
* [Terraform GCP Provider Credential](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/getting_started.html#adding-credentials)

## 2. Google Cloud SDK

### 2.1 Install Google Cloud SDK

You can **skip** this step, if using [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs)

Go to [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive) and download interactive installer for your platform.

### 2.2 Setup your training environment

**01 - Environment Variables**
* Replace **YOUR_PROJECT_ID** with the [GCP Project ID](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#before_you_begin) you are using for the training
* Replace **YOUR_GCP_ACCOUNT_EMAIL** with your GCP account
* **SERVICE_ACCOUNT** is the [GCP Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) to run Terraform with
```
export PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
export GCP_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=YOUR_GCP_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT=sa-cft-training@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

**02 - Verify the environment variables are set**
```
echo "Project: ${PROJECT_ID}"
echo "GCP Account: ${GCP_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}"
echo "Service Account: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}"
```

**03 - Setup & Verify [gcloud configurations](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/config) for the training**
```
gcloud config configurations create cft-training
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set account ${GCP_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}
gcloud config list
```

**04 - Login and authorize gcloud to access GCP with your training user credential**
Use the following command to authorize gcloud to run commands on your behalf. Logging in with application-default mode stores temporary credentials in a well-known location locally for applications like Terraform to use.
```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

## 3. Prepare you training GCP Project

### 3.1 Google Cloud APIs

**Note**: **Skip** this section if you are attending an organized training session.

You will need to enable the following Google Cloud APIs on the training project
* [Service Usage API](https://cloud.google.com/serviceusage/docs/reference/rest)
* [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/)
* [Identity and Access Management (IAM) API](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest)
```
gcloud services enable serviceusage.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
```

### 3.2 IAM roles
You will need add the following IAM policy binding to the account you'll be using in your training project
* **Service Usage Admin** roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin
* **Service Account Admin** roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin
* **Service Account Key Admin** roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin
* **Storage Admin** roles/storage.admin
* **Logging Admin** roles/logging.admin
* **compute Admin** roles/compute.admin
```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member="user:${GCP_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}" --role="roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member="user:${GCP_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}" --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member="user:${GCP_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}" --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member="user:${GCP_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}" --role="roles/storage.admin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member="user:${GCP_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}" --role="roles/logging.admin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member="user:${GCP_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}" --role="roles/compute.admin"
```

### 3.3 Service Account

**Note**: **Skip** this section if you are attending an organized training session.

Following the [least privilidge principle](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/dont-get-pwned-practicing-the-principle-of-least-privilege), create a separate Service Account to run Terraform with.

#### Create Service Account
```
gcloud iam service-accounts create sa-cft-training --description="CFT Training Terraform Service Account" --display-name="CFT Training"
```

#### Verify Service Account
```
gcloud iam service-accounts list --filter="EMAIL=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}"
```

#### Grant IAM Role

Grant IAM roles to the Service Account
* Project IAM Admin
* Storage Admin
* Compute Image User
```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" --role="roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" --role="roles/storage.admin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" --role="roles/compute.imageUser"
```

## 4. Prepare Terraform Credential

Make sure you are in the cloud-foundation-training repository root directory

#### Service Account key

Create and download a service account key for Terraform
```
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create sa-cft-training.json --iam-account=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}
```

#### Setup Terraform Credential

Supply the key to Terraform using the environment variable GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON, setting the value to the location of the file.
```
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON="$(pwd)/sa-cft-training.json"
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON
```
